**To do:**
 
- Do more regularization with the ArDCA [easy] [in progress]
    - run the code [in progress]
    - compare different models for stats and hamming distance

- Figure out initialization procedure [not easy]
    - Multiple runs for initializations 
    - Repeat all figures 

- Diveristy of the sequences vs K. [easy]
- 2nd and higher order stats behave as a function of K .

- Gather and add more references
