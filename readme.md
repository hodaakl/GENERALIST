# GENERALIST: An efficient generative model for protein sequence families
Authors: Hoda Akl, Brooke Emison, Xiaochuan Zhao , Arup Mondal, Alberto Perez, Purushottam Dixit

Generative Model for protein sequences and generally for categorical data. 

## What's in this repo? 
- src/ 

    Contains the source code for GENERALIST , and functions that allow performance assessment.

- jupyter/

    Contains jupyter tutorial notebook that walks through running the inference, generate new data and running tests on the model. 

- benchmark/

    Contains implementation of published code and other developed code to compare other models (AdabmDCA, ArDCA, VAE) to GENERALIST.
    
- previous_versions/

    Contains folders of earlier versions of the code. 

- todo.txt

    Contains list of to do items and ideas for this repo.  

## Getting started

- Hop to the [jupyter tutorial](https://github.com/hodaakl/GENERALIST/blob/main/jupyter/generalist_tutorial.ipynb), there we discuss how to run the inference, generate new data and run statistical and Hamming distance tests.
