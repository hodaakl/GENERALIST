Code implementing a generative Model for protein sequences and more generally for categorical data. 

## Getting started

- Clone this repo. 

- Install the packages at [requirements.txt](https://github.com/hodaakl/GENERALIST/blob/main/requirements.txt)

- Check out the [jupyter tutorial](https://github.com/hodaakl/GENERALIST/blob/main/jupyter/generalist_tutorial.ipynb), there we discuss how to run the inference, generate new data and run statistical and Hamming distance tests. 

- You can also run [main.py](https://github.com/hodaakl/GENERALIST/src/main.py)
