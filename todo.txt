To do:
ðŸŸ¢ add Jupyter tutorial 
[] improve on the benchmark/ardca to make it more obvious what we did with that model
[] add a file for the natural sequences for BPT1 used to get the local optima
[] add folder to include the implementation for ardca , bmdca -- how we get the probabilities from these models.
[] Comment ALL files 
[] Work on readme to 
    ðŸŸ¢ explain what the files are 
[] add to the readme on the repo that fasta file should have all uppercase letters with - as gaps (not . )
[] add readme to each folder in the repo
[] Tell Brooke to edit the Adabmdca repo with her code
âœ… add versions to requires python packages -- src/requirements.txt

Code 


[] i think i should revert back to the input of generalist being one hot encoded matrix, because then it generalizes better for other datasets where the number of categories is not 21 (not a fasta file for a protein) -- or could add another argument where user can also add a one hot matrix.. but i guess that's confusing
[] In convert fasta to np and in covert np to fasta , make the categories list an input so that it can be used over other dataset that is DNA or rNA seq data.
[] save only torch or numpy files for space conservation
[] update the Generator function to use einsum instead of matmul  -- debatable
[] fix the ardca folder in benchmark to add relevant paths and make the code run on repo directory
âœ… create file that runs the inference using only hiperparameters
âœ… make the Convert_fastatoNP funciton learn the sequence length on its own and remove it from compile_generalist 

low priority : 
[] relabel the seqs in the msa which the true label from the OG msa.
